#Contributing

Parasol was written to be extensible, after all the number of on-line services keeps increasing. So we welcome and encourage contributors.

If you'd like a starting point, there are a number of not-yet-implemented modules for some popular on-line services in ./parasol/services.

## How to contribute

If you haven't already, read this [excellent guide](https://akrabat.com/the-beginners-guide-to-contributing-to-a-github-project/) to contributing to a project.

Then, just submit a pull request, making sure there's enough information for us to understand why you are suggesting the change. Ensure that any code is easy to read and in keeping with the existing style.
